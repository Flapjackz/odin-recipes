    <p>Kale pesto is a nice alternative to change things up from making the traditional herby basil pesto. I love to have both in the rotation</p>
    
    <p>Its the perfect pasta upgrade, and you can make it year round since theres usually an abundance of high quality fresh kale at the grocery store available throughout the entire year. Plus its a less expensive option to basil pesto.
