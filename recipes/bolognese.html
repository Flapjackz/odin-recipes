    <h3>What is Bolognese?</h3>
    <p>Bolognese is a slow cooked, thick Italian pasta sauce made up of some type of minced meat (usually beef or pork) and tomatoes. It also includes soffritto which is simply a blend of carrot, celery and onion, and here its used as a base to build up flavor of the sauce.    </p>

    <p>The process involves saut√©ing and gently simmering over the stovetop, and seasonings vary by recipe including things such as herbs, nutmeg or garlic.</p>

    <p>Bolognese is pronounced in Italian boh-loh-nyey-zey and in English bow-luh-nayz.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1 Tbsp pieces, divided*
        </li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups peeled and finely chopped carrot
        </li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped celery
        </li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced (1 1/2 Tbsp)
        </li>
        <li>2 lbs. 85% lean ground beef
        </li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper
        </li>
        <li>2 (28 oz each) cans San Marzano tomatoes in puree, well crushed by hand
        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk
        </li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine, sauce as Sauvignon Blanc
        </li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh basil stems (with leaves)
        </li>
        <li>1 parmesan rind plus 1 cup parmesan for serving
        </li>
        <li>Unsalted chicken stock or broth, as needed to thin sauce
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 1/2 Tbsp butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Saute vegetables: Add onion, carrot and celery and saute 4 minutes. Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer. Transfer mixture to a large plate.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 1 1/2 Tbsp butter in now empty pot over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Brown beef: Dab beef dry with paper towels, then break beef into 4 large chunks into pot. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Let sear until browned on bottom, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Turn and sear until browned again on opposite side, about 3 minutes longer. Then break up beef and cook through a few minutes longer.
        </li>
        <li>Simmer with milk: Return vegetables to pot with the beef, pour in milk and stir. Bring to a simmer then reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until majority of milk has evaporated and just fat remains, about 10 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes, wine, basil and parmesan rind. Bring mixture to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to very low (it should be at a very low simmer with just be a few bubbles over the surface, on my stovetop I have to transfer to a small burner with a low flame).
        </li>
        <li>Let simmer 4 hours, stirring occasionally and thinning with broth as needed. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste as it cooks (keep in mind it will reduce and saltiness will become more concentrated so careful not to overdue it you can always add more later).
        </li>
        <li>Remove basil stems and parmesan rind. Stir in remaining 3 Tbsp butter until melted (or heavy cream if using instead).
        </li>
    </ol>
